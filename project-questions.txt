Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 by id
ii. Hours = 1562 by business_id
iii. Category = 2643 by business_id
iv. Attribute = 1115 by business_id
v. Review = 10000 by id
vi. Checkin = 493 by business_id
vii. Photo = 10000 by id
viii. Tip = 3979 by business_id
ix. User = 10000 by id
x. Friend = 11 user_id
xi. Elite_years = 2780 by user_id

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no

  +------------------------+-----------+---------------+
		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	No, because the users who have the most fans have a maximum of one review. Where as the users with the most reviews (2) have 3, 27 and 1 fans.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
  There are more reviews with the word "love" in them.
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
  SELECT 
    (SELECT count(*)
    FROM review
    WHERE text LIKE '%love%') as love_count,
    (SELECT count(*)
    FROM review
    WHERE text LIKE '%hate%') as hate_count
  FROM review
  LIMIT 1
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT name, fans
  FROM user
  ORDER BY fans desc
  LIMIT 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
  +-----------+------+
  | name      | fans |
  +-----------+------+
  | Amy       |  503 |
  | Mimi      |  497 |
  | Harald    |  311 |
  | Gerald    |  253 |
  | Christine |  173 |
  | Lisa      |  159 |
  | Cat       |  133 |
  | William   |  126 |
  | Fran      |  124 |
  | Lissa     |  120 |
  +-----------+------+

	
	
11. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as “useful” or “funny”?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT name, useful, funny, fans
  FROM user
  ORDER BY fans desc
  LIMIT 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
  +-----------+--------+--------+------+
  | name      | useful |  funny | fans |
  +-----------+--------+--------+------+
  | Amy       |   3226 |   2554 |  503 |
  | Mimi      |    257 |    138 |  497 |
  | Harald    | 122921 | 122419 |  311 |
  | Gerald    |  17524 |   2324 |  253 |
  | Christine |   4834 |   6646 |  173 |
  | Lisa      |     48 |     13 |  159 |
  | Cat       |   1062 |    672 |  133 |
  | William   |   9363 |   9361 |  126 |
  | Fran      |   9851 |   7606 |  124 |
  | Lissa     |    455 |    150 |  120 |
  +-----------+--------+--------+------+
	
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	Yes, there is a strong relationship between having fans and being listed as useful or funny. Of the top 10 users with the most fans 100% of them were listed as useful or funny. However, of the top 10 users with the least fans, only 30% of them are considered useful and 20$% are considered funny. So, that proves that there is a positive correlation between having fans and being considered useful or funny.
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes. When grouping by the Auto Repair category, you get a list of companies of which none are open on Sunday's and one is only open Monday - Friday. On the other hand when you group by City there are some businesses who are open 7 days per week. Furthermore, the hours are also more varied when grouping by city. This makes sense since there are a broader range of industries that are encapsulated and hence capturing industries that have (traditionally) different days/hours that they are open for.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes. Grouping by city (Las Vegas) has 14 reviews. While grouping by category has 0 reviews.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Not a ton. The location data for the city grouping is predictably within a very tight range via longitude and latitude. It is a little more spread out when looking at the group by category (again as you would expect). It is interesting though that 3 of the 4 businesses in the Auto Repair category DO seem to be from a pretty similar location.

SQL code used for analysis:
i:  SELECT business.city, business.stars, business.name, hours.hours
    FROM business
    INNER JOIN hours ON business.id = hours.business_id
    WHERE business.city == 'Las Vegas'
    AND business.stars >= 2

    SELECT business.city, category.category, business.stars, business.name, hours.hours
    FROM business
    INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id
    INNER JOIN hours ON business.id = hours.business_id
    WHERE category == 'Auto Repair'

ii. SELECT count(review.text) as total_reviews
    FROM business
    INNER JOIN hours ON business.id = hours.business_id
    INNER JOIN review ON business.id = review.business_id
    WHERE business.city == 'Las Vegas'
    GROUP BY business.city

    SELECT count(review.text) as total_reviews
    FROM business
    INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id
    INNER JOIN review ON business.id = review.business_id
    WHERE category == 'Auto Repair'

iii.  SELECT business.name, business.latitude, business.longitude
      FROM business
      WHERE city == 'Las Vegas'

      SELECT business.name, business.city, business.latitude, business.longitude
      FROM business
      JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id
      WHERE category == 'Auto Repair'
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
The group of closed businesses have a slightly lower star rating than the group of businesses that are open. Though they do both have the same min and max values. This might indicate that star value alone isn't a super reliable predictor.
         
ii. Difference 2:
The group of closed businesses also have A LOT fewer reviews than the businesses that are still open. This may indicate that fewer people were going to the closed businesses which may be an indication of why they closed.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
i.  SELECT is_open, min(stars), max(stars), avg(stars)
    FROM business
    GROUP BY is_open

ii. SELECT business.is_open, count(review.text) as total_reviews
    FROM business
    INNER JOIN review ON business.id = review.business_id
    GROUP BY is_open

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
The analysis I would like to do involves grouping businesses together and seeing if we could find commonalities between businesses that have high star ratings vs businesses that have low star ratings. 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
To perform this analysis I will essentially need all data that relates directly to the business itself. So this means that most of the user data and friend data can be excluded from our SQL query.
So, to be more specific we will need the following tables:
1. business
2. hours
3. category
4. review
5. checkin
6. photo
7. attribute

All of these tables relate in someway to things about the business and hence are relevent variables needed for future analysis.
For example, perhaps businesses that are open for longer hours have higher ratings. Or perhaps businesses that have certain attribute characteristics like OutdoorSeating, or classy ambience have higher ratings.
There are many, many possible factors / combination of factors as to what might influence a businesses star rating.

                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks. |      0 |     0 |    0 |         None |          None |                                                                                                                                  | inside |

The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks. |      0 |     0 |    0 |         None |          None |                                                                                                                  Bone-in Rib-eye |   food |

The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates.

Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause.  |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause.  |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause.  |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause.  |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting. |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |

I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause.  |        |       |      |              |               |                                                                                                                                  |        |
